- 👋 Hi, I’m @AryeAlmendro, nice to meet you. I gladly accept help and advice from accomplished individuals. Coding fascinates me, it's like an endless ever evolving puzzle expressing unlimited imagination and creativity, feeding my compulsive obsession about crunching details and orgainizing data. 
- I've started my coding career using Mimo app and w3schools.com. My goal's are to become a junior developer within the 12 months.
- 👀 I’m interested in game design, blockchain and deFi.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the phaser framework to practice js and to build some demo projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple HTML, CSS and javascript projects.
